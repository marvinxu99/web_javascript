Template Literals (Template Strings)

Strings are one of the most common programming constructs. This is why it’s so embarrassing that natively declaring strings is still poorly supported in many languages. For a long time, JS was in the “crappy string” family. But the addition of template literals put JS in a category of its own. Template literals natively and conveniently solve the two biggest problems with writing strings: adding dynamic content and writing strings that bridge multiple lines: 

const name = 'Ryland';
const helloString =
`Hello
 ${name}`;

I think the code speaks for itself. What an amazing implementation.
